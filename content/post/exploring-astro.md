This blog runs on Hugo and there's really nothing about it that Hugo does not handle with little trouble. [Astro](https://astro.build/) is a relatively new (released in 2021) JavaScript web development framework that has seen rapid growth and acceptance. I thought I'd experiment with Astro if for no other reason than ot see what all the excitement is about.

## Why Not Dig Deeper Into Hugo?

I've gotten comfortable in Hugo and can get things done as I need to. The only unsettling thing about Hugo is its temple language: Go Template. The syntax is pretty odd and no other Static Site Generator uses it. Astro's primary template language is .astro and it's a lot like [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), but not exactly. It seems like it'd be an improvement over Go Templates.
